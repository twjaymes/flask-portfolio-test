The Pallets team is pleased to release [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) 2.11.0.
[Read the changelog](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/page/changes#version-2-11-0)
for the full list of changes. Some of the bigger changes include:

* Drop support for Python 2.6, 3.3, and 3.4. This will be the last
  version to support Python 2.7 and 3.5.
* A new `jinja2.ext.debug` extension adds a ``{% debug %}`` tag to
  quickly dump the current template context.
* A new `ChainableUndefined` type allows silently ignoring attribute
  access on undefined variables.
* Loop context variables like `loop.length` and `loop.nextitem` work
  better in both sync and async environments.
* Improved compile and runtime performance.

## Version 3.0 Coming Soon

As outlined in [Ending Python 2 Support](ending-python2-support.md),
2.11.x will be the last version to support Python 2.7 and 3.5. The next
version will be 3.0 and will support Python 3.6 and newer.

The package name will remain "Jinja2" and imports will remain `jinja2`.
"Jinja2 3.0" looks a little weird, but given the years of community
momentum behind the name, we concluded it was less disruptive to keep it
as-is.

## Install or Upgrade

Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/) with pip:

    pip install -U Jinja2

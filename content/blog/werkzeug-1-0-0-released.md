The Pallets team is pleased to release Werkzeug 1.0. Werkzeug is the
low-level WSGI and HTTP toolkit that powers Flask. It's been almost 13
years since the first commit, and this milestone for the project brings
many fixes and
changes. [Read the full changelog](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/page/changes/#version-1-0-0)
to understand what may affect your code when upgrading.

- Drop support for Python 3.4. This will be the last version to
  support Python 2.7 and 3.5.
- Remove most top-level attributes provided by the `werkzeug` module
  in favor of direct imports. If you haven't already, use
  [version 0.16](werkzeug-0-16-0-released.md) first to see
  deprecation warnings while upgrading.
- Cookies support the ``samesite='None'`` option. Cookies are parsed
  as a `MultiDict` instead of overwriting repeated keys.
- The development server supports 2-way TLS, making it easier to
  develop applications that inspect client certificates.
- When building URLs with host matching, the current host is accounted
  for when deciding what rule to build.
- When defining and matching URL rules, consecutive slashes are merged
  by default to match the behavior of common HTTP servers.
- The `Accept` header preserves order for tags with equal quality and
  considers options on each value. The  `Accept-Language` header can
  match the primary tag if the specific value is not present.
- Added CORS header attributes to `Request` and `Response`.
- A URL rule can be marked as a `websocket`, in which case it will
  only match for `wss://` requests. This allows async web frameworks
  to use Werkzeug for routing.

## Version 2.0 Coming Soon

As outlined in [Ending Python 2 Support](ending-python2-support.md),
1.0.x will be the last version to support Python 2.7 and 3.5. The next
version will be 2.0 and will support Python 3.6 and newer.

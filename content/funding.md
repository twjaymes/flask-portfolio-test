## Tidelift Enterprise Subscription

[Tidelift][] provides tools, data, and strategies that help organizations
assess risk and improve the health, security, and resilience of the open source
used in their applications.

When a company subscribes to Tidelift, their subscription fee is dived up to
their various open source dependencies. When companies that use Pallets use
Tidelift, part of their subscription goes directly to supporting Pallets. In
return, Pallets follows Tidelift's guidelines for keeping up-to-date information
and security practices.

# Contact

There are multiple ways to get help in the community or get in contact with the
team. Regardless of the venue, you must agree to follow our
[Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

## Chat on Discord

We use Discord for our chat platform. Anyone may join using this link:
<https://discord.gg/pallets>. Use the `#questions` channel for questions about
your own projects that use any of our libraries; do not post images of code, and
use a paste site like <https://dpaste.com> for long blocks of code. Use the
`#random` channel to post about projects, libraries, and programming news.

The project-specific channels are reserved for contributor discussion, not for
general questions. If you are contributing to one of our projects and need to
discuss anything, use the `#get-access` channel to be able to post.

The IRC channel ``#pallets`` on <https://libera.chat> is connected to the
``#questions`` channel on Discord. In Discord you'll see a `bot` label for IRC
users; in IRC you'll see a `Pallets-` prefix for Discord users.

## GitHub Discussions

You may use a project's GitHub Discussions tab to ask questions. This is more
permanent than chat, and allows feedback and accepting answers.

## Reporting Security Issues

Responsibly report security issues by [drafting a private security advisory][advisory]
on GitHub, or email us at [security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com).
See our [Security Policy](security.md) for details.

[advisory]: https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability

## Reporting Conduct Issues

You may confidentially report [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) issues that
occur in any venue by emailing us at [report@palletsprojects.com](mailto:report@palletsprojects.com).
If the issue occurred on GitHub, you may also report content through its
interface. If there is a public issue on Discord, you may ping the `@moderators` group.

## Email

To email us about anything that is not related to security or conduct, use our
general email, [contact@palletsprojects.com](mailto:contact@palletsprojects.com).

## Twitter

We do not currently use Twitter. Our account `@PalletsTeam` is currently
private.

## Stack Overflow

Some of our community members are active on Stack Overflow. However, Pallets
does not actively monitor questions, and cannot vouch for answer quality in
general. Always seek out official documentation first.

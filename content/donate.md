# Donate to Pallets

Pallets projects are downloaded over 100 million times per month. You or your
company might be using our frameworks directly, but consider that the tools you
use may use us behind the scenes as well. Being able to fund the maintainers,
and hire additional help such as designers, technical writers, or project
managers can help us stay focused and productive. The Pallets teams does what
they do because they love the frameworks and they love to code, and we are
grateful to the community support that helps that continue. Thank you!

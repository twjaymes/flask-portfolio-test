# Pallets Community Ecosystem

The [Pallets-Eco][] organization is a collaborative community to share the
responsibility of maintaining libraries that work with and extend Pallets
libraries.

[Pallets-Eco]: https://github.com/pallets-eco/

Anyone can join to get write access to the projects, to submit, review, and
merge PRs, and triage issues. Trusted users, including the Pallets core team,
have the ability to publish new versions of any library on request from another
member.

Over time, an individual maintainer's availability can change, and they may no
longer be able to maintain a project as they once did. By joining Pallets-Eco, a
maintainer can transfer a project to be collaboratively maintained by the
community who uses it. They retain access, but no longer have the pressure to do
everything themselves.

## Help Us Grow

The Pallets-Eco organization is based on the successful [JazzBand][]
organization. We're still in the early days of setting up the community, and
still need to set up guidelines, automation, and other resources for
contributors and maintainers. If you would like to help with that, please join
and help us grow!

## Joining the Community

Join our Discord chat server using this link: <https://discord.gg/pallets>. Once
there, you can use the `#pallets-eco` channel to introduce yourself and ask to
join, and to discuss anything about the organization.

A trusted user will invite you to the GitHub organization.

## Transferring a Project

If you maintain a well-known extension that of a Pallets library, and need
assistance with that effort, you can transfer the project to Pallets-Eco.

After joining the organization, you can use [GitHub's transfer feature][] to
transfer the repository to the Pallets-Eco organization. You'll retain access,
and the other organization members will gain access. Only trusted users can make
releases, so you don't have to worry about security issues.

# Report an Issue

Include the following information in your post:

- Describe what you expected to happen.
- Include a [minimal reproducible example][] to help us identify the issue. This
  also helps check that the issue is not with your own code.
- Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there was an exception.
- List the version of Python and the Pallets library you're using. Check if this
  issue is already fixed in the latest release or the latest code in the repository.

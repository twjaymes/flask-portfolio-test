# Asking and Answering Questions

Please don't use the issue tracker for this. The issue tracker is a tool to
address bugs and feature requests in the project itself. Use one of the
following resources for questions about using Flask or issues with your own
code:

- First, search the web with your preferred search engine, giving the project
  name and a specific search term such as an error message.
- Ask in the `#questions` channel on our Discord chat: <https://discord.gg/pallets>.
- Use the project's [GitHub Discussions][] page for long term discussion or
  larger questions. Each project has its own Discussions page.
